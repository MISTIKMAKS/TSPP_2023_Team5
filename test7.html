    <p align="center" class="maintexttitle" style="color: #686868">1. Forum</p>
    <p align="center" class="maintext" style="color: #686868">1.1. Forum Etiquette</p>
    <p align="center" class="maintext" style="color: #686868">1.1.1. Watch your language in comments, don't be rude, don't use offencive language, links, images. This will lead you at least to detention</p>
    <p align="center" class="maintext" style="color: #686868">1.1.2. Be respectful to others, all can have their word, their opinion and it often can't be declined by others. But if this would be out the rules, we need to remove it, and give a detention or block by rules. Law And Order must be made, because without it, all would be anarchy</p>
    <p align="center" class="maintext" style="color: #686868">1.2. Topic Rules</p>
    <p align="center" class="maintext" style="color: #686868">1.3. "Everlasting Eye Of Justice"</p>
    <p align="center" class="maintext" style="color: #686868">1.3.1. We Are Here... Yeah. Don't think that your posts aren't reviewed. Our Mighty CGC will see topics, that are posted in user forums, and if they conflict with rules, you will regret what you done. What will be? Well, we will KILL... AHEM... Sorry, habbit... We will give you a detention, if Our Council will decide, that post is negative, but not that bad (Broke rules, that weren't too strict), or we will block you for a reason. You can get blocked, by doing something in relapse, OR by breaking strict rules. Also, you can be blocked for some time, or permament, this will also decide council. So, if you want to be an active person in our comunity, please, don't break rules. We apreciate your activity, but we apreciate Law And Order too, and We think most of the Users too, so, be kind, so you will not be punished, OK?</p>
